This is Yuru Liang's personal homepage.

## A short introduction

I am Yuru Liang (梁钰茹 in Chinese), currently a Master's student at the School of Agricultural Economics and Rural Development, Renmin University of China. I am a member of the Department of Resources and Environment under the same school, supervised by Prof. [Minpeng Chen](http://www.sard.ruc.edu.cn/szll/zzjs/qzjs/5ab3449b4e764fc9a2beda18bd8b55f7.htm). Prior to this, I obtained my B.S. in 2023 at Chongqing Normal University.

My research interests lie at the intersection of AI, climate change, and society. Currently, my work focuses on the influencing mechanisms of forestry farmers' adoption of adaptive behaviors.
